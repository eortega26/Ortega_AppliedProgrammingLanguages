- This program creates a linked List and deletes the last node in the list.

- To compile use the command: g++ -O2 -o LinkedList LinkedList.cpp

- This will create an executable file called LinkedList.exe

- To run type the command: ./LinkedList.exe

- So far the program can only delete the last node in the list.
